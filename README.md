# Spring Boot Pagination
A simple pagination example with Spring Boot and JPA.

The app needs a MySql database named `bookstore`.  
Make sure to enter the correct credentials inside the [application.yml](src/main/resources/application.yml).

If you've run the app successfully, it should start on port `8080`.  
The one and only endpoint is the following: `/api/v1/books`
